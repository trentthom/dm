## Virtual drum machine
Users can play sounds by clicking the pad squares or by pressing the corresponding letter on the keyboard.
The sounds get their data via an API which links them to a url.

They will soon be hosted on Cloudinary.

The backend is for Admins only. They can add sounds, configurations, and more sound banks.
